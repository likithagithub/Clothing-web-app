# Clothing-web-app
This is an online shopping web app where we can choose the dress colour of our choice, size fit and quantity of the dress. Then click on add to cart button where a cart message pops up informing about colour and size of our choice. Also we can view the thumbnails images in the main image screen by clicking on the image. This is easy and user-friendly.
This repo contains index.html,script.js,style.css and images(assests for styling) files.
